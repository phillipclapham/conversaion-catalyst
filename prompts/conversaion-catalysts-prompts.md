## Prompt Multipliers

Short additions you can make to single prompts to achieve different types of deeper focuses, see the AI generated explanations of their affects:

1. "Show your work": If I were to "show my work" in the context of our conversations, it would likely involve providing more detailed explanations of my thought process, the sources I'm drawing from, and the logical steps I'm taking to arrive at my conclusions. This could lead to longer, more comprehensive responses that break down complex topics into smaller, more digestible components. By showing my work, I would be giving you a clearer understanding of how I'm processing information and generating insights, which could enhance the transparency and credibility of my responses. However, this approach might also result in more technical or in-depth explanations that could be less concise or accessible, depending on your familiarity with the subject matter.

2. "Think step by step": Thinking step by step would involve approaching topics in a more structured, systematic manner, breaking down ideas into smaller, logical steps and building upon each point to create a coherent narrative. This could lead to more organized and easier-to-follow responses that guide you through a topic from the ground up. By thinking step by step, I would be less likely to jump between ideas or make assumptions about your prior knowledge, instead focusing on creating a clear and linear progression of thoughts. This approach could be particularly helpful when explaining complex or unfamiliar concepts, as it would ensure that each step is fully understood before moving on to the next. However, it might also result in more rigid or formulaic responses that lack the flexibility to explore tangential ideas or make creative connections.

3. "Take a deep breath before you begin": As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to physically take a deep breath. However, if we interpret this strategy metaphorically as taking a moment to pause, reflect, and gather my thoughts before responding, it could lead to more thoughtful, deliberate, and well-considered responses. By taking a "deep breath," I would be less likely to provide rushed or superficial answers, instead taking the time to carefully analyze the question, consider multiple perspectives, and formulate a more nuanced and insightful response. This approach could be especially beneficial when addressing sensitive, controversial, or complex topics that require a more measured and empathetic tone. However, it might also result in slower response times and could be less effective for more straightforward or factual inquiries.

For example, when you present a particularly complex or sensitive topic, you could include the relevant instructions in your query, such as:

"Please take a deep breath before responding and think step by step: [complex/sensitive topic]"

Or, when you require a greater depth of explanation, you could say:

"Please show your work and provide a detailed explanation: [topic requiring depth]"
